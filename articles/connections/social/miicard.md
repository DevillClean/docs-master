# Connect your app to miiCard

The miiCard service has been officially deprecated, so the ability to create new accounts has been disabled, and eventually, the service will be shut down completely. To learn more, see [miiCard](https://theidco.com/miicard/). 

If you already have self-management capabilities on your miiCard account, you may be able to complete Auth0 setup until miiCard is fully shut down.

The `Consumer Key` and `Consumer Secret` should be available on the __miiCard Business Portal__:
